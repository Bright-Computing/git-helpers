.SH git\-bc\-log(1) \-\- Show text\-based graph logs
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]git\ bc\-log\f[] [] [] [[\-\-] ...]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
Show text\-based graph logs.
.PP
The command adds options to the builtin git\-log(1) command to prettify
the output as a graph.
All options of \f[C]git\ log\f[] are also applicable for this command.
Please refer to git\-log(1) for additional options.
.SS OPTIONS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]\-a\f[], \f[C]\-\-all\f[]: Show all the branches in the log.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]<revision\ range>\f[]: Show only commits in the specified revision
range.
When no \f[C]<revision\-range>\f[] is specified, it defaults to HEAD
(i.e.
the whole history leading to the current commit).
For a complete list of ways to spell \f[C]<revision\ range>\f[], see
gitrevisions(7).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C][\-\-]\ <path>...\f[]: Show only commits that are enough to explain
how the files that match the specified paths came to be.
.RS 2
.PP
Paths may need to be prefixed with "\-\-" to separate them from options
or the revision range, when confusion arises.
